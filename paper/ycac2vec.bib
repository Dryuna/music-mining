  abstract = {Novice composers often find it difficult to go beyond common chord progressions. To make it easier for composers to experiment with radical chord choices, we built a creativity support tool, ChordRipple, which makes chord recommendations that aim to be both diverse and appropriate to the current context. Composers can use it to help select the next chord, or to replace sequences of chords in an internally consistent manner. To make such recommendations, we adapt a neural network model from natural language processing known as Word2Vec to the music domain. This model learns chord embeddings from a corpus of chord sequences, placing chords nearby when they are used in similar contexts. The learned embeddings support creative substitutions between chords, and also exhibit topological properties that correspond to musical structure. For example, the major and minor chords are both arranged in the latent space in shapes corresponding to the circle-of-fifths. Our structured observations with 14 music students show that the tool helped them explore a wider palette of chords, and to make "big jumps in just a few chords". It gave them "new ideas of ways to move forward in the piece", not just on a chord-to-chord level but also between phrases. Our controlled studies with 9 more music students show that more adventurous chords are adopted when composing with ChordRipple.},

  title = {Visual {{Word2Vec}} (vis-w2v): {{Learning Visually Grounded Word Embeddings Using Abstract Scenes}}},
  shorttitle = {Visual {{Word2Vec}} (vis-w2v)},
  abstract = {We propose a model to learn visually grounded word embeddings (vis-w2v) to capture visual notions of semantic relatedness. While word embeddings trained using text have been extremely successful, they cannot uncover notions of semantic relatedness implicit in our visual world. For instance, visual grounding can help us realize that concepts like eating and staring at are related, since when people are eating something, they also tend to stare at the food. Grounding a rich variety of relations like eating and stare at in vision is a challenging task, despite recent progress in vision. We realize the visual grounding for words depends on the semantics of our visual world, and not the literal pixels. We thus use abstract scenes created from clipart to provide the visual grounding. We find that the embeddings we learn capture fine-grained visually grounded notions of semantic relatedness. We show improvements over text only word embeddings (word2vec) on three tasks: common-sense assertion classification, visual paraphrasing and text-based image retrieval. Our code and datasets will be available online.},
