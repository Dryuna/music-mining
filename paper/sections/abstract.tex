We apply a word embedding model to a large corpus of classical music to learn an embedding space where chords are represented by real-valued vectors.
The first two principal components of the embeddings of major triads are arranged on a circle.
In music from earlier composers, this circular topology is more evident than in later composers who used less counterpoint.
Remarkably, the order in which major triads are arranged on this structure corresponds to their order in the circle of fifths.
The emergence of this structure is justified by reasoning about the probabilistic embedding model and the composition of classical music.
We situate our results in the context of current statistical research into functional harmony in common practice music.
We show how this technique can be used for large-scale, quantitative stylistic analysis of music.
