word2vec is a word embedding model for natural language. We apply word2vec to a large corpus of common practice music. The first two principal components of the embeddings corresponding to major triads are arranged on the boundaries of a circular topology. In music from earlier composers,the topology is more well defined. Remarkably, the order in which major triads are arranged on this structure corresponds to their order in the circle of fifths. We situate our results in the context of current statistical research into functional harmony in common practice music. We then hypothesize reasons for the emergence of this structure.
