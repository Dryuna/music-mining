We discuss traditional statistical models of harmonic categories in classical music and propose the utility of recent word embedding models in reasoning about sequences of chord tokens from a large symbolic music corpus. In training four word2vec embedding models on time-delimited corpora and plotting the location of major triads in the embedding space, we recover a representation of the circle of fifths in both the distribution of and arrangement throughout the learned spaces.

The notion of the major triad's conjectured `stability' in the statistical sense learned by the probabilistic embbeding model cannot correspond precisely with the sense captured by a discourse of metaphorical tonal stability that is evident in centuries of traditional analytic music theory. Nevertheless, we suggest that word embedding models can be used to model one of the chief intuitions of functional harmonic theory: the importance of major triads whose roots are related by perfect fifths to classical music.
